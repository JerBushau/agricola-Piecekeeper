TODO:
-----
- *consider mobile friendly commands*
- fully test for browser compatibility
- different color (perhaps red) ripple effect when rolling back
- organize CSS to make it easier to iterate over code
- This application needs some documentation on the available commands and how to use them, e.g. shift+click on a accumulation space to increment by the default value of clicked space. Ctrl+click on any accumulation space to toggle a small display in the top right of each space that informs the user of the value of the space at the time of the last accumulation (helpful to fix accidental gathers and such). Shift+click on the accumulation button to roll back to the last round.

What I've learned (so far):
---------------
While creating this site I set out to learn more about OOP in Javascript. I attempted to implement the MVC pattern to better understand the problems that many of the modern MVC frameworks are trying to solve, in order to gain some insight into their designs. While it is far from perfect I did learn a lot.
http://todomvc.com/ and specifically https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/vanillajs was very helpful in attempting this.
Each project I do is a learning experience with Git. I recently discovered how to create Git aliases and have developed a love for one that seems to be quite common:
- Git lola = git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all
I also learned about a neat meta tag that allows one to style the default browser bar color on mobile version of chrome.
- <meta name="theme-color" content="{{#your-hex-here}}">

things to consider for next iteration:
--------------------------------------
- Still need to learn a lot more about events in the browser and a better way to bind the buttons.
- As a separate project re-build this using Vue.js to learn the basics.
- Possibly create a mobile (web)app to control the board, so that it can be hosted on a large display and controlled by mobile devices of many concurrent users.
